		<p>[Verse 1]<br>
		I found a love for me
		Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
		Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
		Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
		'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
		Not knowing what it was
		I will not give you up this time
		But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
		And in your eyes, you're holding mine</p>
		<br>
		<p>[Chorus]<br>
		Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
		Barefoot on the grass, listening into our favourite song
		When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
		But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight</p>
		<br>
		<p>[Verse 2]<br>
		Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
		She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
		I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
		To carry love, to carry children of our own
		We are still kids, but we're so in love
		Fighting against all odds
		I know we'll be alright this time
		Darling, just hold my hand
		Be my girl, I'll be your man
		I see my future in your eyes
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>[Chorus 2]<br>
		Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
		Barefoot on the grass, listening into our favourite song
		When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
		I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight
		<br>
		<br>
		[Instrumental]</p>
		<br>
		<p>[Chorus 3]<br>
		Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
		Barefoot on the grass, listening into our favourite song
		I have faith in what I see
		Now I know I have met an angel in person
		And she looks perfect
		I don't deserve this
		You look perfect tonight</p>
